Sahil is a very exceptional Video Editor.

He understands the core concept of editing and knows the science behind a Good Video.

His editing skills truly transforms a Simple Video to very professional Video which helps attract attention of the audience and hence increases the impressions of the Video.

I highly recommend him if you are looking for Short form or Long form Video Editing.

Keep up the good work , Sahil.
